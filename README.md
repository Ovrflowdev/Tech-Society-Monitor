# Tech & Society Monitor
Tech & Society Monitor is a rss news reader about cybersecurity and how tech is influencing todays society ! <br>
It is based on the Astro framework and built with NodeJS.

This project was made for RSS @ Hackclub ! <br>

Even if the MVP is finished, I'll try to make some cool updates (such as implementing a custom rss feed feature).
